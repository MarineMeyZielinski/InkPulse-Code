            <summary> How to make an appointment ?</summary>
            Several options are available to book an appointment with one of our artists.
            You can reserve online, call the shop during opening hours,
            visit the shop in person during opening hours, or
            send us a message via our contact page.
            Check our contact page or book online now.<br><br>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How much do tattoos cost ?</summary>
            Tattoo prices depend on several factors: location, size,
            complexity, and style. Our studio offers a minimum rate
            of 60 euros, and our hourly rates range between
            100 and 200 euros depending on these factors.<br><br>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>I’ve made an appointment, how soon can I get my design ?</summary>
            Depending on your appointment date, you should be able
            to see a design about 3 to 5 days beforehand.
            This is the ideal time to request changes to your design.
            Don’t wait until the appointment to make changes,
            as this could prevent you from getting tattooed on the day.<br><br>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How long does it take for my tattoo to heal ?</summary>
            Healing time varies depending on the person,
            location, tattoo complexity, and amount of shading.
            You will know your tattoo is healed when it no longer flakes
            and feels smooth to the touch.<br><br>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I get a tattoo if I’m taking medication ?</summary>
            Yes! Many medications and health issues do not affect
            the tattooing process. A medical clearance signed
            by a healthcare professional may be required before tattooing.
            Please inform your tattoo artist of any medication that may
            thin your blood or reduce clotting, as well as any health problems
            that could seriously affect you in case of an open wound.
            This is for YOUR safety, NOT to limit our liability.
            We want you to be healthy and have a beautiful tattoo!!<br><br>

            <summary>Can a 16-year-old get a tattoo with parental consent ?</summary>
            Legally, a minor can get tattooed with written and signed parental consent,
            but ethically, we do not tattoo minors within our premises.<br><br>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What should I do before my tattoo appointment ?</summary>
            There are many good things to do before getting tattooed,
            though not necessarily in this order: it’s always good to eat a meal beforehand,
            bring a bottle of water, take a thorough shower, arrive 10 to 15 minutes early
            to fill out paperwork, wear loose and comfortable clothing,
            avoid drugs and alcohol the day before and at any time before,
            and get plenty of rest.<br><br>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I bring my child(ren) while getting tattooed?</summary>
            Children are welcome in our shop with their parent.
            However, if you are getting tattooed, the other parent
            or legal guardian of your child MUST be present.
            Children must be under the constant supervision of their legal parent(s)
            inside the shop. <br><br>
